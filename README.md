# MuteStartup

MuteStartup turns off startup sound.

This technique is only tested on following devices and system versions, but I think it works on any Mac with Mac OS X 10.6 to 10.8 (maby on earlier system versions):

MacBook Pro 9,1 (10.8)
MacBook Pro 4,1 (10.6, 10.7)
MacBook 7,1 (10.6)
iMac 8,1 (10.6)
iMac 10,1 (10.6)

There is no warranty or guarantee for this program.

MuteStartup installs hooks for login and logout and following scripts, wich are called from the hooks:

/Library/Scripts/mute-on.sh
/Library/Scripts/mute-off.sh

This program is based on following information:
